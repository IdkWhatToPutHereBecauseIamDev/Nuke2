# 🧨 Nuke Window Chaos Engine  
### *A harmless browser prank for friends who deserve it.*

This project creates an endless swarm of bouncing popup windows that refuse to die.  
Each window loads a YouTube link, bounces around the screen, respawns if closed, and new ones spawn on a loop.  

It’s chaotic. It’s loud. It’s ridiculous.  
And yes — it’s meant **only for trolling friends and family who are in on the joke**.
